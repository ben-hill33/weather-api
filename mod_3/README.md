# Module 3: Downloading Weather Data

See [here](../assets/CEIS110_Module3_Project_Guide.docx) for Word document download.

## Objectives

- [x] To practice writing and executing Python programs using Anaconda Spyder IDE
  - In this case, using Python's built-in virtual environment and Visual Studio Code
- [ ] To learn how to use download data from the cloud using an API
- [ ] To learn how to create a relational database
- [ ] To learn how to save data into a database table using SQL and Python

## Parts List

Equipment:

- Internet-connected PC running the Python venv via VS Code

## Introduction

### Downloading Weather Data

- The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides free access to nationwide weather observations via a cloud-based Application Programming Interface (API).
- You will create and run a Python program to download a data set of recent weather observations for your location.
- Your Python program will create a database on your computerâ€™s hard drive and store the weather data in a table for later analysis.

## Steps

- Recommended to use a virtual environment such as Anaconda for beginners in Python.
- Copy the following code into the window. You'll need to modify a few things:
  - Change the `name` and `date` to your own.
  - Chage the zip code to your own local 5-digit zip code
  - Save your program as BuildWeatherDb.py. **_NOTE_**: You should create a CEIS110 class folder, if you have not already done so, and save this and all your other Python files for this project into that folder.
  - Your weather database will be created in the same folder where your Python code files are saved. All Python programs must be in the same folder as the database in order to access the data.
  - Please pay attention to the create table command in the following code.
  - In the `createTableCmd` you will be creating an observations table with the fields:

```sql
timestamp
windSpeed
temperature
relativeHumidity
windDirection
barometricPressure
visibility
textDescription
```

The data types of each field are listed next to the field names below.  The `insert` command enters the data into the table.

```python
#Purpose: Build weather database from NOAA data
#Name: Your name
#Date: the date
#   See https://pypi.org/project/noaa-sdk/ for details on noaa_sdk package used

# parameters for retrieving NOAA weather data
zipCode = "90808"  # change to your postal code
country = "US" 
#date-time format is yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ, times are Zulu time (GMT)
#gets the most recent 14 days of data
today = datetime.datetime.now()
past = today - datetime.timedelta(days=14)
startDate = past.strftime("%Y-%m-%dT00:00:00Z") 
endDate = today.strftime("%Y-%m-%dT23:59:59Z")
