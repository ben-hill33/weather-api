# Develop Graphical Models and Interpret Results

## Objectives

- To learn how to use Python data analytics modules
- To compare data at different times.
- Use data analytics to interpret and analyze data from a database

## Introduction

IoT devices, websites, social media, and other sources generate a significant amount of data.

This data must be:

- gathered
- stored
- cleansed
- processed
- analyzed

Each step in this project has focused on gathering and processing the data. This part of the project focuses on data analysis with `pandas`, the data analytics module in Python.

You should have two CSV files and at least one xlsx file. Each CSV file probably contains about one week of weather data (this might be different for your location). The first CSV file contains data for the first (older) time period and the second CSV file contains data for the second (more recent) time period.
